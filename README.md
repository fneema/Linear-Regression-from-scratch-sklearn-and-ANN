# Linear-Regression-from-scratch-sklearn-and-ANN

In this notebook, we implemented linear regression model from scratch. To ensure that the model works well, we used scikit learn library to implement the same model. We went ahead and built an artificial neural network using keras. The data that was used here is the famous diabetes data.
